# Evolutionary Algorithm

This is a program that converts any random string of text into a specified target string of text. This is done through an evolutionary (genetic) algorithm that creates the next string, which is closer to the target string, based on the previous string of text. This way, the random string is converted into the target. This is done in increments of generations, the number of which depend of the random string created.
